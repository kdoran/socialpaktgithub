Setup: 

1. Install postgres

4. Create postgres database, user, and password in pgadmin (or on command line)
5. python manage.py syncdb --migrate
6. python manage.py runserver
7. Go to the /admin and add the same product categories that are on www.socialpakt.com/admin

9. Same with a home category
