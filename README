Setup: 

1. Install postgres
2. Install python libraries in requirements.txt (sudo pip install <package-name>)
3. Update your settings file to point to a local image 'server' by changing MEDIA_ROOT to be a local dir not in the repo (e.g. '/Users/kevin.doran/Pictures/socialpakt') and the MEDIA_ROOT_URL to be '/static/images/uploads/'
4. Ignore any local settings file changes (probably a better way to do this): git update-index --assume-unchanged settings.py
5. Create postgres database, user, and password in pgadmin (or on command line)
6. python manage.py syncdb --migrate
7. python manage.py runserver
8. Go to the /admin and add the same product categories that are on www.socialpakt.com/admin
9. Same with product variations (mens, womens)
10. Same with a home category
11. Same with some example products
